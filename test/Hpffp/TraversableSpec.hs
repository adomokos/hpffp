    You might notice the similarity between fmap and bind
    fmap     :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
    (=<<)    :: (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b
    traverse :: (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)
    ...
    traverse f = sequenceA . fmap f

    mapM is traverse

    mapM :: Monad m => (a -> m b) -> [a] -> m [b]
    - contrast with -
    traverse :: Applicative f => (a -> f b) -> t a -> f (t b)

    What traversable is used for?
    Anytime you need to flip two type constructors around, or map something
    and then flip them around, that's probably `Traversable`.
